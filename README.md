# Game of Nim
A mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns subtracting numbers from a random range. On each turn, a player must remove a range of numbers between 1 and 3 inclusively, once the random game range is 0 or less than 0, the other player wins

# The Standard Game
The code implements the game of nim. It starts by printing a random number within the range of 20 to 30 as the game range. The user is then asked to input a number between 1 to 3, and this input is subtracted from the game range to get a new game range. If the new game range is greater than 0, the computer's turn starts. The computer's turn involves selecting a number between 1 and 3, which is then subtracted from the game range to get a new game range. The computer's input is determined using a series of if-elif conditions. If the game range becomes less than or equal to 0, the user wins. If the user's input is less than or equal to 0, the user loses. If the game range becomes less than 1, the user also loses. If the user inputs an invalid value, the code throws an exception, and the user is asked to try again.

# Using Reinforcement Learning
The code is written in Python, using the random and numpy libraries. The player is given the option to play against the computer. The computer's moves are determined using reinforcement learning and a Q-table, which stores the expected reward for taking a certain action in a certain state. The computer's behavior is controlled by two variables: the learning rate alpha and the exploration rate epsilon. The computer selects a random action with probability epsilon, and selects the action with the highest value in the Q-table with probability 1 - epsilon. The values of alpha and epsilon change over time based on the number of games played.

The game starts with a randomly generated pile of 40 to 60 stones. The player inputs a number between 1 and 3, representing the number of stones they want to remove. The game continues until either the player or the computer takes the last stone, at which point the game ends. The player has the option to rematch, and the score is kept track of throughout the game.
